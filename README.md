# Hi there 👋

Im a engineering physics student at KTH, currently in my second year. 

Still just a beginner programmer, but want to learn more 😄

## About this github

- Python and Matlab so far
- Copied code over from my school projects (for easier viewing in one place)
- Projects from courses:
        DD1331 - Grundläggande programmering
        SF1672 - Linjär algebra
        SF1544 - Numeriska metoder grundkurs IV
        SF1681 Linjär - algebra fortsättningskurs.

The code is written by me alone or a big portion of it is (if it was a group project).
